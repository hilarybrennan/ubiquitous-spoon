# Welcome to ubiquitous-spoon!

## FAQ:

**1. What is ubiquitous-spoon?**

Simply put, ubiquitous-spoon is a literary magazine edited by AI. The name refers to both the magazine itself and the machine learning model used to generate it.

**2. How is ubiquitous-spoon licensed?**

The code behind the model is licensed under the [GNU gplV3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html). All literary and artistic works submitted, selected, and published are the intellectual property of their creators. We will never, ever do anything to try to change that. 

**3. How can I contribute to ubiquitous-spoon?**

If you want to contribute to the code, just open a pull request. Please remember that kind contributors use comments! 

If you want to contribute to the magazine, please send a submission in a `.txt` attachment with the title `SUBMISSION-[YOURNAME]/[TITLE]` to ubiquitous.spoon@gmail.com. Please be aware that right now we are not set up to respond promptly, and your submission may be temporarily lost in the void and may be ineligible to submit to journals and presses that don't accept simultaneous submissions for some time. We understand that this is a big problem hope to be able to speed up our process in the near future.

If you are a visual artist and you want to contribute to future iterations that include visual art, stay tuned while we brush up on our computer vision skills. 

**4. Do you pay your contributors?**

The short answer is an emphatic yes. 

The long answer is: we don't yet know how much. The current plan is to pay a small honorarium for publication out of pocket by the code maintainers (as well as contributor copies), and then to do some kind of profit sharing. Because we don't yet know how much interest there will be in this project, we do not know the exact amounts. 

## Navigating the Repo

This repo contains 3 directories. 

The first directory is called [BLOG](https://github.com/hilarybrennan/ubiquitous-spoon/tree/load-clean-data/BLOG), which is a blog. If you are interested in the process of creating and maintaining this project, want to know more about the impetus for the project or biographical details of its maintainer(s), go there. Someday we may have a website. For now we have a repo.


The second directory is called [DOCS](https://github.com/hilarybrennan/ubiquitous-spoon/tree/load-clean-data/DOCS). This is where all of the technical documentation for contributing to and using the software is kept. If you are a developer who would like to contribute to the project, please start with ["Getting Started"](https://github.com/hilarybrennan/ubiquitous-spoon/blob/load-clean-data/DOCS/getting-started.md).

The final (or perhaps first) directory is the root directory. This where the code lives. 

*A note about data:* You will  notice that neither the training set nor a set of submissions lives in this repo. That is by design, and is intended both to preserve the privacy of contributors as well as the copyright status of works included in the training set, and to ensure a clean testing and submission process.

## Data Collection Policy

The data collection policy lives here. 

Right now we are not collecting any data that does not live in this repo (e.g. your github username as connected to a PR or bug) or the [ubiquitous-spoon email inbox](mailto:ubiquitous.spoon@gmail.com). 

We are deeply committed to managing data with transparency and integrity, and will update out Data Collection Policy faithfully as things change.
